#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering is the process of developing solutions for problems in the real world using computer technology.
its importance in tthe real world is for communication, commerce,entertainment,health care and other human related problems. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The system level.

The function level.

The data level.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning which involves defining the software’s purpose and scope, much like pinpointing  destination and plotting the best route.

Requirements Analysis, which  seeks to identify and record the precise requirements of the final users. 

 Design phase is all about building the framework.

 The Coding phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is when engineers and developers get down to business and start converting the software design into tangible code.

 Software testing involves a thorough examination of the software for any bugs or glitches that might have slipped through during coding.
 
 The Deployment phase involves rolling out the meticulously tested and fine-tuned software to its end-users.
 
Maintenance phase is characterized by constant assistance and improvement, which guarantees the software’s best possible functioning and longevity and ensures it meets customer expectations.

  


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The main difference is that Waterfall is a linear system of working that requires the team to complete each project phase before moving on to the next one while Agile encourages the team to work simultaneously on different phases of the project.

When to use waterfall methodolgy is when all the requirements are known, clear, and fixed.
when there are no ambiguous requirements. when the project is short and simple. when  the development environment is stable.
when resources are adequately trained and available.
when the necessary tools and techniques used are stable, and not dynamic.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A software developer should be able to consult with stakeholders, product managers and clients to gather software requirements. 

A quality Assurance Engineer should be able to  collaborate closely with developers from the project's inception, fostering a comprehensive understanding of the application's intended purpose and functionality among the team.

A project manager in software organize software projects and can assign tasks to software engineering teams according to the specifications of a task.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

 Integrated Development Environments allowing developers to manage source code repositories efficiently.

 
Version control systems streamline development processes, enabling faster iteration and delivery of features. 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

 Ineffective communication among team members and across cross-functional teams
 
  Absence of Guidance from Management 

  Difficulty in Estimating Time & Resources


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit tests are very low level and close to the source of an application. They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software.

Integration tests verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together. For example, it can be testing the interaction with the database or making sure that microservices work together as expected. 

Acceptance tests are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is like giving a special instruction  to a  robot.  

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Explain  software engineering.
How will you explain software engineering to a five year old child using pictures
The improved prompt is more effective because the information is more clearer and straight forward.
